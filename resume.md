Experience
----------

**Software Engineer, Universo Online:**

Short text containing the type of work done, results obtained,
lessons learned and other remarks. Can also include lists and
links:

* First item

* Item with [link](http://www.example.com). Links will work both in
  the html and pdf versions.

**Intern - Software Engineer, Universo Online:**


**Intern - Applied cryptography and mobile security researcher, CPqD:**
CPqD is a independent research institution, focused in the innovation of Information Technology.
Here, in my very first professional experience, i've worked in a military founded project aimed to improve android security (Including Kernel and Core Libraries),
applying advanced cryptography concepts, exploring new algorithms and vulnerabilities.  

Technical Experience
--------------------

My Cool Side Project
:   For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition
    list can be used to have named items.

    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.

Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

Programming Languages
:   **Java:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **C/C++:** I have a strong C/C++ background, since high school, .

:   **Clojure:** Currently my favorite hipster language, i use it whenever i can, even if it means that i can only use in small projects :)

:   Basic knowledge of **x86, MIPS and ARM9 assembly**, **C#**, **Javascript**, **Python**, **Ruby**
